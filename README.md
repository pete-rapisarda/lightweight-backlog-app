ðŸ“Œ **Project Status: Paused**

As of [April 25, 2025], active development on the Lightweight Backlog App is paused.  
The project structure (issues, roadmap, and board) is fully set up and ready for resumption when bandwidth allows.

Current focus is on completing the FastAPI Blog Project.  
This backlog app remains a priority for future development.

Next steps when resuming:
- Review the Phase 1 MVP Epic
- Begin working through the open issues in the Development Roadmap board
- (Optional) Set a 4-week iteration to manage progress
